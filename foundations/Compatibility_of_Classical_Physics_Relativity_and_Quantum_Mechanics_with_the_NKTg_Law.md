## Abstract

This publication presents a consistent systematization of the compatibility between the pillars of modern physics and the NKTg Law on varying inertia. The NKTg Law is shown to be non-contradictory to classical theories, while allowing their dynamical structures to be abstracted into a unified state relationship among position, velocity, and mass.

## Scope Statement

This publication focuses on establishing the conceptual consistency and compatibility of the NKTg Law with existing physical theories. The content is not intended to replace, refute, or claim full proof of any established theories.

## 🧪 Theoretical Basis

The NKTg Law describes the tendency of motion of a physical object through the relationship among:

- Position (**x**)
- Velocity (**v**)
- Mass (**m**)

**General formulation:**

$$
\mathrm{NKTg} = f(x, v, m)
$$

The system is characterized by two core product quantities (unit: **NKTm**):

- **NKTg₁ = x · p**  
- **NKTg₂ = (dm/dt) · p**

## 1. With Isaac Newton – Classical Mechanics

When the mass of the system does not vary with time:

- Condition: $ \frac{dm}{dt} = 0 $
- Consequence: $ \mathrm{NKTg}_2 = 0 $

$$
\mathrm{NKTg} = \mathrm{NKTg}_1 = x \cdot p
$$

---

## 2. With Albert Einstein – Relativity

Energy–mass equivalence:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Mass variation:

$$
\frac{dm}{dt} \neq 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{NKTg}_2 \neq 0
$$

---

## 3. With Werner Heisenberg – Quantum Mechanics

Vanishing mass limit:

$$
m \to 0 \Rightarrow \frac{dm}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{NKTg}_2 = 0
$$

Thus:

$$
\mathrm{NKTg} = \mathrm{NKTg}_1 = x \cdot p
$$

The expression $x \cdot p$ is structurally compatible with the uncertainty relation  
$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p$.

---

## Conclusion

The NKTg Law remains structurally compatible across classical, relativistic, and quantum regimes by reducing to appropriate limiting forms without violating established physical principles.
